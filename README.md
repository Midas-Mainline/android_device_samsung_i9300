# Device tree for Samsung Galaxy S3 (i9305)

This device tree can be used in combination with the AOSP master
branches and the mainlinish Linux kernel developed at
git@git.putti.eu:aosp/kernel_i9305.git

Compile the kernel with: `ARCH=arm make midas_defconfig && ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi- make zImage dtbs && cat arch/arm/boot/zImage arch/arm/boot/dts/exynos4412-i9305.dtb > Image.gz-dtb`

Copy the compiled kernel then to device/samsung/i9305-kernel/.

Run the following commands to build AOSP:

`
. build/envsetup.sh
lunch lineage_i9305-userdebug
make -j9
`

Run the following command to test the built image:

`heimdall flash --BOOT out/target/product/i9305/boot.img --SYSTEM out/target/product/i9305/system.img`
